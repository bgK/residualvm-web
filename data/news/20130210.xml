					Some time has passed since doomsday, and we're still around to see the aftermath,
					the time since then has not been wasted however. Today we release ResidualVM 0.1.1
					which is a service-release bringing you roughly 40 gameplay-fixes, varying from very
					minor fixes to quite visible bugs, 14 of these fixes were also in the original
					game as it was released back in 1998.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a list of what has been fixed, see the <a href ="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/blob/branch-0-1/NEWS">
					NEWS-file</a>.

				<p>
					So, head on over to our <a href="https://residualvm.org/downloads/">downloads-page</a> and grab
					a fresh copy of ResidualVM 0.1.1 to enjoy the best possible Grim Fandango experience we can
					offer to date.
