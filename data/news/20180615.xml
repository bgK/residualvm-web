<p>
	Our previous release is already a few months old, it's time for a bug-fix release! ResidualVM 0.3.1 is available <a href="https://www.residualvm.org/downloads/">on our downloads page</a>. It fixes a couple of Myst III bugs:
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a rare crash when walking near the magnetic rings in Amateria.</li>
		<li>Fixed unresponsive controls for the holographic projectors in J'nanin.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	That's not much, but Cyan and GOG.com are planning to use ResidualVM for the Myst III digital release and we want it to be as stable as possible.

	In other news, progress on adding support for The Longest Journey to ResidualVM continues thanks to our GSoC student Liu "Douglas" Zhaosong. You can follow his work on <a href="https://douglasingsoc.blogspot.com/">his blog</a>.
