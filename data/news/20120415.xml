			We have reached a rather important milestone for ResidualVM, we are gearing up for our first release,
			which will support Grim Fandango. To make sure that we don't have any big showstoppers, we
			need your help.
		</p>
		<p>
			We need people to play through the game thoroughly on all our supported platforms, preferably
			testing all the optional parts that aren't required for completion too. If you are interested
			<a href="https://www.residualvm.org/downloads/">download</a> our 0.1.0 pre-release builds (not the unstable builds),
			and start playing. Any bugs should be reported to our <a href="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/issues">issue-tracker</a>
			on GitHub, and when you complete, you should post in our <a href="https://forums.residualvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=149">forums</a>.
