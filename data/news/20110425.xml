                        It's been over 2 years since the last news on this page, and a lot has happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                        We have switched from svn to <a href="https://www.github.com/residualvm/residualvm">git</a>,
                        and quite a bit has been fixed, which leads me to today's headline:
                </p>
                <p>
                        Grim Fandango just changed status to <b>"completable with a few minor glitches"</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Yes, that's right, you can now play Grim Fandango right through to the end. As a sidenote we now also accept
                        <a href="https://wiki.residualvm.org/index.php?title=Reporting_Bugs">Bug Reports</a> for Grim.
                        So, get on over to the download page, and grab a fresh nightly.
                        Oh, and that compass in the handle, sure will come in handy too!
