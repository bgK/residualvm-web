			We are planning to release ResidualVM 0.2.0 with support for Myst III as our second supported game.
			The Grim engine has had quite a few changes since 0.1.1, so to avoid any big showstoppers for Grim Fandango, we need <it>your</it> help.
		</p>
		<p>
			We need people to play through Grim Fandango and Myst III, preferably testing all the optional parts
			that aren't required for completion too. If you are interested,
			<a href="https://www.residualvm.org/downloads/">download</a> our 0.2.0 pre-release builds (not the unstable builds),
			and start playing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any bugs should be reported to our <a href="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/issues">issue-tracker</a>
			on GitHub, and when you complete, you should post in our <a href="https://forums.residualvm.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=664">forums</a>.

			Details can be found <a href="https://forums.residualvm.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=664">here</a>.
