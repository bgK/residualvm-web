		Adding support for Myst III: Exile to ResidualVM is nearly done.
		Now, we only need your help to find the last rough edges by playing the game thoroughly and reporting any issues you encounter.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are interested, locate your copy of the game, and <a href="http://www.residualvm.org/downloads/">download</a> a daily build (not the 0.1.1 release build).
		Instructions to setup the game can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/blob/master/README">README</a>.
		Bugs should be reported to our <a href="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/issues">issue tracker</a> on GitHub.
		Once you have finished, please report your testing results in our <a href="http://forums.residualvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=651">forums</a>.
